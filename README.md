# Data-Science
3-2 Data Science course

<em>DS1<br></em>
Exercise a : Make linear regression with graph<br>
Exsercise b : Calculate mean, variance, standard deviation and draw graph<br>
Exercise c : Generate 10000 random integers and print occurrence count for each value and draw pie chart<br>
Exercise d : Given an integer n, generate a random n by n matrix M, and compute the product of M and its inverse, which should be an identity matrix.<br><br>


<em>DS2<br></em>
Read the CSV dataset file<br>
Cleaning dataset and make linear regression<br>
Draw scatter plot

<em>DS3<br></em>
Problem 1 : Read the Excel dataset file, and compute the linear regression equation E for the input dataset D. For of each record, compute e = w-w', where w' is obtained for h using E. Normalization e values and decied value a <br>
More program : Divide the record into two group and repeat problem1<br>
Problem 2 : Lab1 : Ex-1-a & 2-a & Minilab2 - problem1
